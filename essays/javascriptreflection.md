<h1>Introduction</h1>

So far, learning JavaScript has been a fun experience. I had experience with JavaScript before taking the FreeCodeCamp course, but I did learn some new things I was unfamiliar with before taking the ES6 course. One of the new things I learned in the ES6 course was arrow functions and how they differ from regular functions in JavaScript. I thought that arrow functions were unique and that they offered a simpler alternative in some situations where I needed to reduce the size of the code and make the code more readable. I think that JavaScript is a good coding language as it is robust and versatile. It offers diversity and I like how it is run nearly everywhere in your browser. As for the practice WODs, I found them to be extremely useful in my understanding of the syntax for JavaScript. The practice WODs allowed me to get used to writing arrow functions and improved my comfortability with JavaScript. Finally, I think that JavaScript will work for me as the syntax is extremely similar to Java, and my background in JavaScript will give me a slight advantage towards my understanding as a software engineer.
